docker build -t medium-scraper .
docker run -p 8000:8000 medium-scraper
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Notes

- All data files are saved in a `downloads/` directory for organization and safety.
- Only filenames that exist in `downloads/` can be downloaded; invalid or directory-traversal attempts are blocked.
- Each scrape creates a uniquely named file using the query and timestamp.
- For extended deployments, consider rate limiting and old file cleanup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending

- Add authentication for private APIs.
- Schedule automatic jobs or background scrapes with Celery or FastAPI BackgroundTasks.
- Deploy to Render, Koyeb, Railway, AWS (see their docs for Docker support).
- Enhance selector robustness for Medium UI changes.
